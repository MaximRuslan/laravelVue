Hello 
Let explain in detail what's we need

We use this theme (https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-admin-dashboard-template/landing/) the Vue + Laravel version 
you can see this here (http://161.35.76.201/)

We need to create 3 access (Super admin; Owners; Employees)
We need to create the full Authentification page (http://prntscr.com/shhqx2)

- For Super admin side we need only Login and Lock Screen page
- For Owner side we need all of them (http://prntscr.com/shhqx2)
- For Employees side we need all of them (http://prntscr.com/shhqx2) except Registration page because Employees will be created by Owners

Note: 
Super admin can see all Owners, he don't need to see all employees 
Each owners will create his own Employees, that mean Owner 1 cannot see the Owner's 2 employees


==== For Super Admin side ====
- Remove this (http://prntscr.com/setl9t)
- Remove this (http://prntscr.com/setpmv)

Hide those menus (and leave all menus and should be for all users):
- http://prntscr.com/seu7o9
- http://prntscr.com/sev12u
- http://prntscr.com/sevfp0
- http://prntscr.com/sevkz0

#1: - Dashboard
Super admin view should be like that (https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-laravel-admin-template/demo-3/dashboard/ecommerce)
- We need this only (http://prntscr.com/rvgkbh) and (http://prntscr.com/rvgee7) and (http://prntscr.com/rvgf58 + http://prntscr.com/rvgfq2)
About this (http://prntscr.com/rvgkbh) should have (Owner; Pending owner; Invoice due; Ticket) 
About this (http://prntscr.com/rvgg7g) should be the data from the all invoices  ########
About this (http://prntscr.com/rvggs6) should be the data from the all tickets   ########
About this (http://prntscr.com/rvgh5j) should be the data from the all active owner and trial owner
About this (http://prntscr.com/rvghvi) should be the data (Total Owner; Owner in pending; Total Free Owner)

#2: Instead "Users" write "Owners"
We need a page like that (https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-laravel-admin-template/demo-3/apps/user/user-list)
- here (http://prntscr.com/s4rynp) should have (ID; Owner name (with picture); Created date; Country; Payment status; Status; Verified)
and here (http://prntscr.com/s4s01g) we should use this filter (Country; Payment status; Status; Verified)
Also we need same function when we tap here (http://prntscr.com/s4s1kf) that mean is open the page like that (https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-laravel-admin-template/demo-3/apps/user/user-view/268) 
Then SuperAdmin can edit or delete the Owner


#4: Make a new page and call it "Package"
Make it same as this page (http://accufy.originlabsoft.com/admin/package)
Credential = admin/1234


#5: Make a new page and call it "Categories"
Make it same as this page (http://accufy.originlabsoft.com/admin/business/categories)

==== For Owner side ====

- http://prntscr.com/seu7o9

- http://prntscr.com/sevfp0
- http://prntscr.com/sevkz0

But as I said before Onwers should have to register and the register page should be like that (http://accufy.originlabsoft.com/register):
About this part (http://prntscr.com/sc5liv) Should be related to this part in Super Admin side (http://accufy.originlabsoft.com/admin/business/categories)
Then this part (http://prntscr.com/sc5nck) Should be related to this part in Super Admin side (http://accufy.originlabsoft.com/admin/package)
